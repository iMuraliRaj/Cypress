Intro:
 - Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. 
 - We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.
 - We can make it possible to 
           (a). Set up tests
           (b). Write tests
           (c). Run tests
           (d). Debug tests
 - Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. 
 - Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.
