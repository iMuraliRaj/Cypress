Intro:
 - Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. 
 - We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.
 - We can make it possible to 
           (a). Set up tests
           (b). Write tests
           (c). Run tests
           (d). Debug tests
 - Cypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. 
 - Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.           
 - This enables you to write faster, easier and more reliable tests.
 
 Features:
 1. Time Travel:
     (a). Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run
     (b). Hover over commands in the Command Log to see exactly what happened at each step.
     
 2. Debuggability: 
     (a). Stop guessing why your tests are failing. Debug directly from familiar tools like Developer Tools.
     (b). Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.     
 
 3. Automatic Waiting:
     (a). Automatic Waiting: Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. 
     (b). Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.
